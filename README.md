# Home-Depot-Hack
We made this hack for the Home Depot hack night at Vanderbilt University. We had a few hours to come up with something, and we decided to make an app to help find the name of something that you can describe with verbal circumlocation. The way it works it take in a string of words, parses it to remove common words, then does a Google search and scrapes the text of the top 10 results. Then, it returns the most common words, and hopefully one of them is the word you were looking for. Given the time constraints, the app is flawed, but it does occasionally return the word you were looking for in the top results.
